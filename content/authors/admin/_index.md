I am a project research assistant in meteorology affiliated with the  National Taiwan University.  I am broadly interested in storm physics, precipitation processes, emphasizing on the multiscale interaction between storms and environment leading to extreme precipitation. In all of my research projects, I tried to combine a love of field work and numerical modeling to illustrate hidden relationships in the data. The main observational tool I used is polarimetric radars, which can be used to infer kinematic and microphysical processes in precipitating storms. Physical inferences gleaned from observations can be further tested with physical process limiting modeling. A recent collaboration with Ming-Jen Yang (NTU) and Wen-Chau Lee (NCAR) on the development of a new radar observable to reveal information on difficult-to-observe storm thermodynamics, exemplify my research approach well.
